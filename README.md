# About me

I am a currently a student and working on several different projects including the use of various software. It is important to realize that the world isn't perfect but that should not be a reason to stop trying making the world a better place.

However, I'm a dreamer and I believe that we all are possible to achieve goals together as a society. Furthermore, I do want to share my accomplishments in the future, which I think are helpful in achieving those goals. Money is a valubale resource and it can help in accomplishing something - denying this was probably one of the dumbest things I have done.
